PartnerEnablerService folder contains the service implementation. We build apk out of this folder.
It depends on two other libraries for now. One is PartnerEnablerAIDL and other one is PartnerVerifierLibrary.
May be we add more library dependencies later in the project to support Navigation, GDA or esofw api usage.
